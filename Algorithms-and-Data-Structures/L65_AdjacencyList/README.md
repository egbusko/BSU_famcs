An undirected graph is defined by a list of edges. Build an adjacency list of this graph. It is guaranteed that the graph has no loops or multiple edges.

**Input**\
The first line contains two integers n and m — the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and the number of graph edges (0 ≤ m ≤ 200000). The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. The next m lines describe the edges: each line contains two space-separated vertices u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and u ≠ v), which are connected by an edge.

**Output**\
Print the adjacency list of the graph as n lines. In the i-th line print the number of vertices adjacent to the i-th vertex, and then the numbers of these vertices, separated by a space, in any order.

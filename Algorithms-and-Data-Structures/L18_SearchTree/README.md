## Problem 18
Input file name: tst.in\
Output file name: tst.out\
Time limit: 1 s\
Memory limit: no

Find the vertices through which an even number of the largest half-paths pass, and delete (by right deletion) one of them whose key is the smallest (if there are no vertices that satisfy the desired property, then nothing needs to be deleted from the tree).

**Input**\
The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order they were added to the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has at least two vertices.

**Output**\
The output file must contain the sequence of vertex keys obtained by direct left traversal of the resulting tree.

An undirected graph is defined by a list of edges. Construct the adjacency matrix of this graph. It is guaranteed that the graph has no loops or multiple edges.

**Input**\
The first line contains two integers n and m — the number of vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the number of graph edges (0 ≤ m ≤ n(n − 1) / 2). The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. The next m lines describe the edges: each line contains two space-separated vertices u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and u and v are different), which are connected by an edge.

**Output**\
Output the adjacency matrix of the graph: n lines, n numbers each, each number is 0 or 1, the numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.

## Problem 0.1. Build a tree
Input file name: input.txt\
Output filename: output.txt\
Time limit: 1s\
Memory limit: 256 MB

Given a set of keys, build a binary search tree and perform a direct left traversal of it.

**Input**\
The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order they were added to the tree. The keys are specified in the format one per line.
In a search tree, all keys are, by definition, unique, so if you try to add a key to the tree that is already there, it is ignored.

**Output**\
The output file must contain the sequence of vertex keys obtained by direct left traversal of the tree.

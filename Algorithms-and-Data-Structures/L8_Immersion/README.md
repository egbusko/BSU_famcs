Input file name: in.txt\
Output file name: out.txt\
Time limit: 1 s\
Memory limit: no

The shape of the body is given by matrix A of size n ×m. The element aij corresponds to the height of a horizontal square area of size 1 × 1 relative to the lower base. The base of the form is horizontal.

It is necessary to determine the volume of water that has not flowed out if the body sinks completely into the water, then rises.

**Input**\
The first line contains two numbers — n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000).
Starting from the second line there are n ⋅ m non-negative integers — elements of the matrix A.

**Output**\
Display the amount of water that has not flowed out.

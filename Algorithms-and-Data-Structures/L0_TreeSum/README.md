A binary search tree is given in which the vertex keys are integers in the range from −231 to 231 − 1 inclusive. Find the sum of the keys of all nodes in the tree.

**Input**\
The input file contains a sequence of numbers - the keys of the vertices in the order they were added to the tree. The keys are specified in the format one per line.
In a search tree, all keys are, by definition, unique, so if you try to add a key to the tree that is already there, it is ignored.

**Output**\
Print a single number — the sum of the keys in the constructed tree.

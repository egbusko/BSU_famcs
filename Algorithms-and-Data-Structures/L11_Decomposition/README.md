## Problem 11. Number decomposition
Input file name: input.txt\
Output file name: output.txt\
Time limit: 1 s\
Memory limit: no

Three numbers a, b and c are given. It is necessary to determine whether the number a can be represented as a = x1 ⋅ x2 ⋅ … ⋅ xk, where k ≥ 1, b ≤ xi ≤ c and xi, a, b, c are integers. In addition, it is required to minimize the number of multipliers. You should also provide for the option when such a representation does not exist.

**Input**\
The only line contains the numbers a, b and c (2 ≤ a ≤ 1 000 000 000, 1 ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 1 000 000) separated by a space.

**Output**\
If there is no expansion, print a single number −1, otherwise print the least number of factors in the expansion.

Given a directed graph G containing n vertices and m arcs, each arc (u, v) is assigned a capacity cuv.

It is required to find in this network the maximum flow from the source (vertex 1) to the sink (vertex n).

**Input**\
The first line contains two numbers n and m — the number of vertices and arcs in the graph, respectively. It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200.\
Each of the next m lines contains three numbers ui, vi, wi — two vertices connected by an arc and the capacity of this arc. It is guaranteed that ui ≠ vi, 1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 1000000 for each arc.

**Output**\
Print a single number — the maximum possible flow in the given graph.

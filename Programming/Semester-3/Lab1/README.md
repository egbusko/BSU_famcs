## Laboratory work 1. Real numbers

Develop a console application in Java.

The function is presented as its own translation. Calculate the approximate value of the sum of this infinite series. Calculations end when the next storage usage modulo is less than the given number e. The view of this decision is mandatory:
 e = 10^(-k), where k is a natural number.

Compare the result with the value calculated using standard functions. Print both results to the console.

The x and k values ​​are entered from the keyboard.

The **output** of the results is achieved using the results of the decimal point of view.  

**Requirements:**  
all logic of the link application in a separate class;  
handle exceptions;  
clean code.

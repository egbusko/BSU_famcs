## Test 1
   **Task**  
   Develop a console application in Java.

The input file input.txt contains text with different delimiters between words. The file may be empty. The file can have multiple lines. The register doesn't matter.


It is required to find the number of occurrences of each word in this text and output the words to the output1.txt file sorted in non-increasing order of this number.

For each word, when outputting in brackets, indicate the number of its occurrences in the text.
  
\
For example, for text:

    one, two is 2, three one two, many words: one

output:

    one(3) two(2) is(1) 2(1) three(1) many(1) words(1)



Words that occur in the text the same number of times should be output in the order in which they first appear in the text.  
In the file output2.txt output all different delimiters in ascending order of character codes.  
In the file output3.txt output all different characters in descending order of character codes.



Correct output1.txt - 4 points.  
Correct output2.txt - 1 point.  
Correct output3.txt - 1 point.

 

Using an iterator - 1 point.  
Implementation of sorting using stream - 2 points.  
Creating a separate class to implement the functionality - 1 point.

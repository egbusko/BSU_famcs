## Laboratory work 10. Checking a web page for correct links

*Additional task*

Sometimes when working with a web page, you have to deal with incorrect links.  
You try to follow the link, and you receive a message that such a document does not exist or there is no page at the specified address.  
It is necessary to implement a page check for the correctness of links.  

The input file *input.html* contains a link to the initial web resource or text written in HTML.

The output file *output1.txt* should contain a list containing the pairs:  
*link - the title* of the page, if it is a link to a web page and  
*link - file size*, if it is a file, if the resource was found.

The output file *output2.txt* should contain a list of links where the resource was not found.

## Test2 
**Task**  
Develop a console application in Java.

The input file input1.txt contains text with different delimiters between words. The file may be empty. The file can have multiple lines. The register doesn't matter.


> Caesar's cipher. In this cipher, the message is encrypted by replacing each letter with a "shifted" letter. If you shift the letter "a" to the right by one position, you get the letter "b". If you shift the letter "a" two positions, you get the letter "c", and so on. And so in a circle.

The decryption process is the opposite action - we shift the letter in the encrypted phrase by a certain number of characters to the left.



The input1.txt file contains the encrypted text in English.  
Punctuation marks are not involved in the encryption process.



The input2.txt file stores at least 5 words of the original text before encryption.  
The text needs to be decoded. Output the decrypted text to the output.txt file.
